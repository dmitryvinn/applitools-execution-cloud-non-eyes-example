# Example of Using Execution Cloud with non-eyes automation through Selenium WebDriver, Jest and JavaScript

This repo has a short example of how to use the Applitool's Execution Cloud to test a web app with Selenium WebDriver, JavaScript and Jest, while running non-eyes (non-visual) functional tests.

## Deployment

After you build the project, you will need to set your Applitools API key and then simply run an NPM command:

```shell
export APPLITOOLS_API_KEY=[YOUR KEY]
npm test
```
